# CSC431: Download of Public facing Data

Users are interested in downloading: 

```
* cadastral data -> points and polygons on a map
* "storytelling" data -> images, videos, audio, etc. 
```

This grants users a springboard to create their 
own maps, e.g., a map pertaining to violence 
or bus stop information. This will also serve 
to expedite the process of receiving land titles.
